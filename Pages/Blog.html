              This scenario may be imagined, but it certainly represents a
              common experience for many customers who do research on a brand’s
              website but end up buying from a retail partner. For Amy, the
              quality of her end-to-end customer journey depends on both the
              brand and the retail partner. To succeed in the face of shifting
              market dynamics and increasingly empowered customers, brands and
              retailers need to rethink their partnership dynamics to focus on
              their shared responsibility for customer experiences. To do this,

              As a business owner or manager, it's vital to make sure your
              employees feel properly recognized for all the hard work they do
              day in and day out. When workers see that there's more to getting
              the job done than simply receiving a pat on the back, they are
              often inspired to work harder, especially if there are incentives
              involved. This kind of engagement is invaluable to meeting and
              exceeding individual and collective goals, and keeping the whole
              company's bottom line going strong. One idea that may help your
              business stay on a course for success is hosting an awards
              ceremony every so often - be it every month, once a quarter or
              annually. This typically ensures people are not only being
              recognized and rewarded for their hard work, but that everyone in
              attendance really gets a feel for the kind of high-quality work
              winners put in.

              you want to give gifts to clients, and how much you'd like to
              invest each time.
